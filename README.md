# CR-10 IDEX Project
PROJECT STATUS: ALPHA

This repo contains information about a DIY Low Cost IDEX Upgrade to the CR10 family of printers (My machine is a CR10 V2). The project is in alpha as assembly and testing have not yet been completed.

Upcoming BOM and CAD will be here.

Toolhead used is 2x Voron Stealthburner's with Clockwork 1 Extruder. Extruders can be any supported by Stealthburner, although I use E3D V6 as they are very cheap.

Check back soon for more updates.
